  This app exists not only to decide the fate of apples and oranges, but also to be of amusement to you! <br>
  So if you decide that the fate of apples and oranges is beneath you, just put in any old thing, compare them!<br>
  <br> Settle arguments! <br>
  <br> Create controversy!<br>
  <br> But also note that the decisions made by the celestial banana are not perfect and are subject to your input. Please do not take
  everything, or even anything, the celestial banana says seriously. Bananas are not to be trusted, particularly in cases where you choose
  to fly under banners that relate to hate speech or violence in any way. If you need more guidance on these issues, I would strongly encourage
  you to speak to a counselor or trusted adult.
  <br><br> Now get comparing!<br><br>
  App brought to you by the Flaming Puppies
