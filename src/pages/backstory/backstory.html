      <h1 id= "txt3"> The banana agreed to be a judge, but would need more information to judge the merit of each fruit.
        <br>It asked each to choose a thing to fly under by which it would make its choice. <br>But what words to choose? The choice is yours… </h1>

      <h1 id="txt2">No one quite knows how it happened, but someone tried to compare apples and oranges, and that’s how it all began.
        <br>Battles for superiority broke out all over the land, and there was carnage everywhere.
        <br>They knew there could only be one solution to end the juice-shed.
        <br> They took their disagreement to the only impartial judge—the celestial banana. </h1>

      <h1 id="txt1">For many years, the fruits lived in harmony. <br> The apples and the oranges always knew they were different,
        but this didn’t bother them. <br> They just accepted that they were incomparable and left it at that.</h1>
