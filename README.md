## About

In Apples and Oranges, the apples and oranges need your help in resolving a serious dispute. Once upon a time, the apples and oranges lived in peace and harmony, accepting their differences. But one day, someone tried to compare apples and oranges, sparking battles for superiority all across the land. To end the argument once and for all, the apples and oranges agreed to bring their dispute to the great Celestial Banana for judgement. Each side would present a word to the Banana, and the Banana would decide which one was better. The apples and oranges need you to pick the words...

This app exists not only to decide the fate of apples and oranges, but also to be of amusement to you. So if you decide that the fate of apples and oranges is beneath you, just put in any old thing, compare them! Settle arguments! Create controversy!

But also note that the decisions made by the celestial banana are not perfect and are subject to your input. Please do not take everything, or even anything, the celestial banana says seriously. Bananas are not to be trusted, particularly in cases where you choose to fly under banners that relate to hate speech or violence in any way. If you need more guidance on these issues, I would strongly encourage you to speak to a counselor or trusted adult.
